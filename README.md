# SaaS App Boiler Plate

## Goal

Build a standard set of functions that can be extended to many different product ideas. It should include the following:
- ability for user to log in
- user profile management
- user account management, incl. subscription management w/ payment option
- standard multi pane home page (e.g. www.buystockfoo.com/dashboard, auth'd)
- standard marketing landing page (e.g. www.buystockfoo.com, not auth'd)
